### Embedded RTOS for TI MSP432 in C++

Ported from the **G8RTOS**, a Real-Time Operaing System kernel in C created in Microprocessor Applications 2 üêä.

## Why port to C++?
Many reasons!
- Namespaces: Access control is beautiful now.
- Object-Oriented Programming (WIP): GREATLY simplified/supercharged data structures.
- References (instead of pointers): Safe memory operations.
- STL (WIP)
- Much more...

See [main.cpp](https://github.com/benjamin051000/albertOS/blob/main/main.cpp) for an example of how to interface with the RTOS.
