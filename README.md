### Embedded RTOS for TI MSP432 in C++

Ported from the **G8RTOS**, an RTOS in C created in Microprocessor Applications 2 üêä.

## Why port to C++?
Many reasons!
- Namespaces: Access control is beautiful now.
- Object-Oriented Programming (WIP): GREATLY simplified/supercharged data structures.
- References (instead of pointers): No more annoying deref operations.
- STL (WIP): Need I say more?
- Much more...
